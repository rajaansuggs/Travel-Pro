Project Description
TravelPro is a website that’ll provide some travel itinerary options for travelers to plan their next trip.

Vision - future state for the project
To streamline the vacation planning process.

Mission
The team will work collaboratively to make decisions about the project, with the scrum master primarily responsible for setting priorities and the development team primarily responsible for estimates and completing/merging tasks each week. We will communicate every daily about progress and obstacles. We will collaborate and communicate in the discord server, whenever necessary. We will have group meetings in established time frames (after our Friday and Tuesday morning meetings with the instructor and client respectively). At the commencement of the Tuesday meetings, we’ll have a reflection on the team’s performance, lessons learned and an overall review of all the tasks. After reflection, we will perform our scheduled tasks.  On friday meetings, we will do a check in on everyone’s progress and have more group work time on Zoom meetings.

Success Criteria:
Travelers will be able to successfully enter travel plan locations. Then within a minute, relevant travel itinerary options will be displayed with highly detailed information about each itinerary.
